This is a variation, inspired by @lluisgl7, designed for a larger looseleaf tea infuser. This is a work in progress!

# Automatic Tea Timer
I much prefer full-mug infusers over tea balls as they give the tea leaves more room to spread out, so I decided to alter this design to lift a mug infuser up out of a mug.

## Status

I've put together all the relevant parts on the breadboard. Everything seems to work. The next step will be working on the infuser lifter and getting the timing and speed of the DC motor correct. I've finally learned how to use a laser cutter so I was able to cut out the holder for the infuser.
